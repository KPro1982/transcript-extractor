     | -- Matthew, M-a-t-t-h-e-w, H-e-i-n-d-e-l.· A lot of people [100.0%]
     | say Heindel, so don't worry. [100.0%]
     | · · ·Q.· Mr. Heindel, have you had your deposition taken [100.0%]
     | before? [100.0%]
     | · · ·A.· I have. [100.0%]
     | · · ·Q.· And when was the last time you had your [100.0%]
     | deposition taken? [100.0%]
     | · · ·A.· In approximately May of this year. [100.0%]
     | · · ·Q.· Okay.· And do you recall the nature of the [100.0%]
     | matter? [100.0%]
     | · · ·A.· We have ongoing litigation with a competitor [100.0%]
     | regarding intellectual property. [100.0%]
     | · · ·Q.· Okay.· Any other depositions outside of that? [100.0%]
     | · · ·A.· Well, I've been deposed three times.· This is the [100.0%]
     | third time, the most recent one. [100.0%]
     | · · ·Q.· Okay.· And the other two?· Do you recall the [100.0%]
     | nature of the other two? [100.0%]
     | · · ·A.· One was similar -- intellectual property; and the [100.0%]

     | · · ·Q.· Okay.· You've just been sworn to tell the truth [100.0%]
     | under penalty of perjury just like under oath before a [100.0%]
     | judge and a jury and not telling the truth can lead to [100.0%]
     | possible incarceration or civil fines; so it's important [100.0%]
     | you tell the truth. [100.0%]
     | · · · · ·Do you understand? [100.0%]
     | · · ·A.· Yes. [100.0%]

     | · · ·A.· Yes. [100.0%]
     | · · ·Q.· After my question, your attorney may make an [100.0%]
     | objection.· An objection is like a Post-it note.· It goes [100.0%]
     | on the record, and later the judge will decide the legal [100.0%]
     | issue.· It's not your job to figure out if the objections [100.0%]
     | are valid; therefore, after the objection, we'll still be [100.0%]
     | waiting for your answer unless your attorney instructs you [100.0%]

     | table that you're sitting at with your personal knowledge, [100.0%]

     | round or square or even if I have a table, and that would [100.0%]

     | · · · · ·Do you understand the difference? [100.0%]

     | I've not ever met the plaintiff.· So I looked at a couple [100.0%]
